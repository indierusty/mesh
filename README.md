Messing with Vector Mesh.

### Finding the core algorithm to uniquely identify regions and strokes in the vector mesh.

The core of the challenge is to find the properties of the regions and strokes in the mesh that diffrentiate it from every other region in the mesh. This will help us to being able to apply the styles to every strokes and regions dynamically so the user can create 2D shapes non-destructively. It should be robust enough to handle arbitrary topology for editing and also animation. The original description of the problem: https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/2309.
